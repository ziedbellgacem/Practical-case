## Duration: 1 Hour (15-minute presentation, 45-minute coding task)


## Overview: The interview is designed to assess the candidate's understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and their ability to apply those concepts to a practical coding task. The candidate will first give a brief presentation explaining JavaScript to a beginner audience, followed by a coding task where they will work on a weather app template.


## Interview Agenda:


### Presentation (15 minutes):
The candidate will have 15 minutes to present and explain the fundamental concepts of JavaScript to a beginner audience.
The presentation should be clear, concise, and tailored to someone with no programming experience.


### Coding Task (45 minutes):
The candidate will work on a starter code for a weather app HTML/CSS template.
Their task will be to choose a free weather API, suggest examples, and integrate the API into the template.
They will need to implement functionality to get user input (city name), fetch weather data for that city from the chosen API using JavaScript, and display it dynamically on the HTML template.
The candidate will be assessed on their problem-solving skills, ability to write clean and efficient code, and their understanding of API integration and DOM manipulation.
